# 🚀 Next.js 14 Course Completion

Just completed the Next.js 14 course by Vercel! 🚀

Recently, I've been deep-diving into Next.js, a web framework that's changing how we build applications.

## Highlights:

✅ **Admin Dashboard:** Built a practical admin dashboard covering both frontend and backend aspects with Next.js.

✅ **UI Libraries - Clsx:** Used Clsx for organized styles and tidy components.

Now, it's time to take these skills and apply them to a new project from scratch. Excited to see how this journey unfolds. Stay tuned for updates! 🛠️
